Awarded a light-weight title, this champ holds up its crisp hand high—revealing its billowing drape—and the crowd can't help but go absolutely wild! Derived from the flax plant then spun into linen fiber, this knock-out knit is not only breathable but naturally strong too. Borrowing the look of a slubbed sweater, these nubby yarns act like stratus clouds—running up and down in the knit, going from thick to thin and back again in an unpredictable fashion. Although offering about 25% stretch in its cross-grain, this knit is best equipped for loose-fitted garments that prefer to be draped. Travel the world in t-shirt dresses or cover-ups, midi skirts and oversized tops, long cardigans and more—whichever you may choose, countless silhouettes are well within reach! Translucent in construction—similar to a burnout—lining one's garment is dependant on the application.",

A tricot is a very thin/smooth textured knit consisting of fine or single yarns which form vertical whales on the surface and crosswise ribs on the back; thus resulting in a run-resistant knit. Tricots are often used for the construction of swimwear, underwear, sportswear and gloves. Unlike other tricots, this knit comes complete with higher compression capabilites great for activewear used in cycling, running and compression sleeves. With a remarkable 75% 4-way stretch and a matte finish, curves are no match for the elasticity of this high performance tricot. Surfs up!\n\nNote: This material weighs 200gsm.",

    "description": "Our Clay Chunky Wool Sweater Knit lives its most genuine truth—you guessed it—as a sweater. Whether it be a turtleneck with an exaggerated collar, a wide frame V-neck, cropped cardigan, or just, you know, a sensible standard sweater, we can't deny it's a winter and fall baby. The combination of knit construction and mulch chroma evokes nature and warmth, making it an equally fantastic choice for a scarf or any other cold-weather accessory. Its drape is lightly flexible with a wooly and delightfully uneven hand. Given its open-knit and generous stretch, consider layering garments made from this knit for added opacity and—although it is insulating—warmth.",

One touch is all it will take to fall head of heels. For those who are unfamiliar with neoprene altogether, this material is often used to create scuba-diving and surfing wetsuits or lap top slip covers due to the fact that it maintains its flexibility over a wide variety of temperatures and it displays an enormous amount of chemical stability. Neoprene has also been one of the biggest trends to hit the fashion network this year. This polyester and spandex blended neoprene contains a fantastic 1-way stretch in the weft and is completely opaque.
