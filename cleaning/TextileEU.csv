Prior to the acrylic coating itself, the fabric undergoes a hydrophobic treatment to prevent the acrylic product from passing through the fabric. Therefore, the acrylic coating is only applied on the front side and the structure of the cotton is preserved on the reverse side.
The fabric with an acrylic coating is easy to wash with water, it is not necessary to wash it in a washing machine. Although, if you still want to wash the fabric we recommend washing unfolded at 30 °C and very gently. The fabric lasts 20 washing cycles. Ironing only on the reverse side at a very low temperature up to 150 °C. The fabric has great colour fastness even in bad weather and long life. You will surely enjoy its easy maintenance.
Thanks to this treatment, you can use the fabric both indoors and outdoors. It can be used to make tablecloths, bags, pillows, aprons and bibs, bags for gymnastics or snacks, bags for cosmetics, cases for electronics and much more. It can also be used to renovate changing tables or dining chairs.

Prior to the acrylic coating itself, the fabric undergoes a hydrophobic treatment to prevent the acrylic product from passing through the fabric. Therefore, the acrylic coating is only applied on the front side and the structure of the cotton is preserved on the reverse side.
The fabric with an acrylic coating is easy to wash with water, it is not necessary to wash it in a washing machine. Although, if you still want to wash the fabric we recommend washing unfolded at 30 °C and very gently. The fabric lasts 20 washing cycles. Ironing only on the reverse side at a very low temperature up to 150 °C. The fabric has great colour fastness even in bad weather and long life. You will surely enjoy its easy maintenance.
Thanks to this treatment, you can use the fabric both indoors and outdoors. It can be used to make tablecloths, bags, pillows, aprons and bibs, bags for gymnastics or snacks, bags for cosmetics, cases for electronics and much more. It can also be used to renovate changing tables or dining chairs.

Prior to the acrylic coating itself, the fabric undergoes a hydrophobic treatment to prevent the acrylic product from passing through the fabric. Therefore, the acrylic coating is only applied on the front side and the structure of the cotton is preserved on the reverse side.
The fabric with an acrylic coating is easy to wash with water, it is not necessary to wash it in a washing machine. Although, if you still want to wash the fabric we recommend washing unfolded at 30 °C and very gently. The fabric lasts 20 washing cycles. Ironing only on the reverse side at a very low temperature up to 150 °C. The fabric has great colour fastness even in bad weather and long life. You will surely enjoy its easy maintenance.
Thanks to this treatment, you can use the fabric both indoors and outdoors. It can be used to make tablecloths, bags, pillows, aprons and bibs, bags for gymnastics or snacks, bags for cosmetics, cases for electronics and much more. It can also be used to renovate changing tables or dining chairs.

Although, if you still want to wash the fabric we recommend washing unfolded at 30 °C and very gently. The fabric lasts 20 washing cycles.

Although, if you still want to wash the fabric we recommend washing unfolded at 30 °C and very gently. The fabric lasts 20 washing cycles.

Prior to the acrylic coating itself, the fabric undergoes a hydrophobic treatment to prevent the acrylic product from passing through the fabric. Therefore, the acrylic coating is only applied on the front side and the structure of the cotton is preserved on the reverse side.
The fabric with an acrylic coating is easy to wash with water, it is not necessary to wash it in a washing machine. Although, if you still want to wash the fabric we recommend washing unfolded at 30 °C and very gently. The fabric lasts 20 washing cycles. Ironing only on the reverse side at a very low temperature up to 150 °C. The fabric has great colour fastness even in bad weather and long life. You will surely enjoy its easy maintenance.
Thanks to this treatment, you can use the fabric both indoors and outdoors. It can be used to make tablecloths, bags, pillows, aprons and bibs, bags for gymnastics or snacks, bags for cosmetics, cases for electronics and much more. It can also be used to renovate changing tables or dining chairs.
